Gold star staff We chose Artrip Hotel because of the close proximity to the train station and the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We were in no way disappointed! The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly, in a very natural and caring way. We found the hotel well positioned to walk to the top attractions (Reina Sofia just around the corner), in an interesting area with a not-too-tourist feel, which we really liked. We very much enjoyed our stay at Artrip and Madrid. 	1
Big plusses and a few misses - hesitant to criticize So the good - easy to get to from the train station, lovely, lovely staff - helpful, friendly attentive, eager to please and really there are just times when someone having a good grasp on your native tongue (in this case English) makes this easier and helpful. Most of our trip we had been in an apartment or two separate rooms (two adults and two young teens) but for this one night in Madrid we opted for a family room. A good value at 121â¬ (15% discount for booking early) - one big bed and two twins. The location is good in that it isn't far to walk to many locations. The owner and other woman working were more than helpful about helping us plan for our one afternoon in Madrid. 	1
Warm Welcoming Boutique Hotel We stayed at the Artrip Hotel 26-31 May and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thank you so much Miguel and your wonderful staff for making our visit to Madrid so memorable.	1
Had a fantastic stay, will definitely return. Lovely hotel, lovely staff! We arrived at the hotel after a long delay (10hours!) at the airport - which wasn't a great start to our holiday. However once we arrived at Artrip and were met by the lovely reception staff, we soon forgot about our earlier travel issues. Staff are always so friendly, chatty and helpful - they have a wealth of info about the surrounding areas and sights of the city, and they are more than happy to share and recommend. Reception is also open 24hrs so there is always someone there should you need anything at all.	1
Friendly, clean, and convenient We were very impressed with the Artrip Hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially Sarah. Miguel, the owner, arranged a last minute dinner reservation at his restaurant, which we also enjoyed!	1
Great stay with friendly staff Had four great nights at this boutique hotel. Very accommodating staff including owner Miguel, Jasmina and James. Great area to watch locals rather than tourists. Close to metro and main station. Would definitely stay here again. 	1
Great Small Hotel in Madrid A very warm place with a friendly and excellent staff. When we arrived to the Hotel the owner Miguel opened the door to us and helped us with our luggage. My family enjoyed our stay... This Hotel is GREAT!!! Fantastic accommodation and very clean.... In front of the Hotel is a Laundromat, Metro Station is very close and a Supermarket in front of the Metro.The Shower is awesome! If you have plans to visit Madrid, you need to consider ARTRIP Hotel as an option. We really enjoyed this place!!!!!!! 100% recomended!! Thanks Miguel and Staff for all your attentions!!! 	1
Great boutique hotel Stayed with family for three nights in June 2014. The staff was exceedingly helpful and welcoming. The hotel itself has a very clean and modern look/feel. Coffee/tea available 24/7. Breakfast was excellent by Spanish standards (fresh fruit and pastries), deli meats, cereals and breads and was avaialble until 11:30. We had two rooms, both of which were extremely clean. We had a Junior Suite which was great, although there are no windows that open (except for the shower) and feels a bit stuffy without the AC (there was no fan as in the other rooms). As others have indicated, showers were strong. The Hotel is an outstanding value.	1
Great place to stay I have travelled to Madrid 2 or 3 times a year for 25 years+ and have stayed in a wide range of places, depending on area, price and reviews. These have ranged from utter misery to 'top class'.	1
A personal touch We stopped off in Madrid as part of our honeymoon. We had a terrible time finding our rental car drop off at Atocha station and we walked in tired and a little miserable. Fortunately the staff here help to brighten your day. We were surprised and extremely grateful to find a bottle of red wine and a meat platter with an "enjoy your honeymoon" note. This is above and beyond for a non 5 or 6 star hotel and clearly helps contribute to their high ranking. A special thank you to all the staff that gave great tips and had an infectious enthusiasm. The only downside was our room was never cleaned but I'm sure that was just a small oversight. We'd recommend this on the extremely high level of service and their personal touch. 	1
Modern, great hotel at a perfect location I have stayed at the hotel for one night during July 2014, on a business trip. The location is great - that I knew when I booked - 2-minute walk to Plaza Espana and minutes from the palace. The quality of the room, the friendliness of the staff, the great design - those were all a very welcome surprise. 	1
Bether than expected. When we decided to visit Madrid.a friend of us suggested to book that place. At first we were not very sure about it but i must say it was the best choice. The staff was really friendly and attentive, we felt like if we were at home. The service is very good and the views are stunning. Rooms are large but the bed was not very confortable. Appart from that everything was perfect. 	1
Madrid hotel review Stayed for 3 nights at ApartoSuites Jardines @ Madrid..	1
Faultless - great hotel, friendly staff and awesome views From initial contact to the last, the staff at Apartosuites Jardines de Sabatini were helpful and friendly whilst being discrete and unobtrusive.	1
Excellent Stay in Madrid We booked this hotel online thinking that this would be an apartment but it turned out to be a fully serviced apartohotel. I was with my wife and 17 years old son. It is very well maintained and rooms are daily serviced like any other hotel. 	1
Nice hotel, but away from centre We stayed in a suite with views. The view is excellent. The room was large. But the bed was uncomfortable. The hotel has a car museum which is excellent. But it is a bit of a trek to get to the centre of town, and there aren't many restaurants nearby. Nevertheless, it was a comfortable stay in a lovely city. 	1
Excellent choice What a choice, a 5 minute walk from Plaza de Espana or Principe Pio metro.	1
Hats off to a super hotel - do consider it for your stay in Madrid Smooth check in - everything worked just as it should. Helpful knowledgeable staff who are keen to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Excellent breakfast with attentive staff. This hotel seems popular with Spanish people which speaks volumes for the quality and value. The hotel is in a busy area close to the Royal Palace with wonderful views of the Palace from the rooftop terrace bar (open Tues - Sun). Two Metro stations close by - one uphill and one downhill which works just fine for people like us who caught the metro from the airport. Much of Madrid is easily walkable but we we glad that we had purchased cheap the 5 day transport pass, which for us reasonably fit 60+ tourists was still value for money. DO take extra care around Sol metro station but do enjoy all Madrid has to offer and do stay at this hotel. 	1
A Little Gem of a Hotel! In the frenzy of a busy city like Madrid, the ApartoSuites Jardines de Sabatini is a perfect refuge after a day of sight-seeing. The rooms are large, stylish, hip and very clean! Pedro, Marta and all the rest of the staff were more than helpful in providing guidance through the labrynth that is Madrid. 	1
Great hotel, great value! To start, the shower meets my picky standards, no mildew in there :-) Love having a kitchenette. Our room was quiet (despite facing the road), comfortable, and clean. The location is convenient, not far from downtown and close to Madrid Rio park, as well as being close to metro an Cercenias. The staff are friendly and speak good English. 	1
Location! Location Such an excellent hotel, so central, close to everything and right in the best part of Madrid. Very friendly staff, always helpful, nothing was too much for them.	1
Right in the middle of all the action! This hotel is situated in the busiest area of Madrid close to the sights and the shops. We could easily walk to Puerta De Sol, Plaza Mayor, Place de Espana and Palacio Real. It is very close to 2 metro stations. Traveling on the metro was easy, the ticket machines had an English option and were simple to operate. Gran Via is busy night and day, be prepared to walk everywhere accompanied by hundreds of others. The hotel is quiet, with large rooms and an opulent bathroom. The breakfast buffet is OK for â¬10 each. 	1
Love it so far Currently staying (until 12 July) and I have to say very very happy with choice. It is right in the centre of everything - soundproofed rooms and zircon are a godsend at night! Staff very helpful and hotel decor is beautiful. Even a radio in the bathroom!!!! Had hear that free wifi was only in certain 'areas' of hotel but can confirm it is available in our room. 	1
convenient location, comfortable room We had a double room facing the Gran Via, so we could stand on the balcony and people watch. When the doors were closed, though, the street noises were nearly gone, so no problems sleeping. The room was small but comfortable, and it had everything we needed. It was very clean and the bedding was of good quality. As is usual in Spain, the tissues are doled out in small packages daily - mentioning just in case you suffer with allergies or catch a cold. 	1
Perfect location What a wonderful hotel to stay at right in the middle of Madrid. I stayed with my 3 yr old daughter here and it was the perfect location for us. We could shop all we wanted and had a convenient place to check back into when we needed a break. Love that Starbucks was just down the street. Very clean room, lovely bathroom and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Thanks for a fabulous stay. 	1
Possibly the Best in Madrid We selected this Hotel after the great reviews and we were not disappointed . From the onset of booking online to emails for ways to get there we were elated . The value and location is excellent . Taxi from Airport â¬35 including tip for 3 of us. The Building is beautiful as is the interior and rooms. The management is excellent and are selective with walk'ins. The breakfast is very good with all you may want. Full TV channels in the rooms and I have to mention the cleanliness which is very noticeable . There is attention to detail everywhere . Outside to the right is an ATM and coffee/tapas shops , turn left and you have the tour bus , you can buy the ticket from reception â¬21. Suggestion do not buy the ticket to the Real Madrid Stadium from the conductor on the bus. Buy this ticket at the stadium as the full tour is not always available . The only thing we had difficulty with was finding a good restaurant close by, perhaps if we were here longer we would have done better. Our boys would go out at night to the bars and clubs so we consider this general area safe. Overall we are delighted with this Hotel and would have no hesitation in recommending the Atlantico 	1
Good choice Very 'unobtrusive' from the outside (doorway) good job there is a big sign	1
Loved this hotel...location fabulous, great staff, elegant decor We spent a 4 nights here, then went to Valencia for 2 nights, then returned to Atlantico for 2 nights. It is a lovely, elegant small hotel, nice clean, well appointed rooms (although like most places in Europe, lacking in drawer space for clothing). The staff were extremely helpful--especially Javier--providing maps, directions, making reservations etc. Breakfast was ample, tasty, easy... Rooftop lounge beautiful with amazing views... Location perfect. 	1
Great location - excellent hotel This hotel was booked late on a personal recommendation and it did not disappoint. From start to finish service was excellent and attentive at all times. Most impressively was the hotel was immaculate throughout, bedrooms, restaurant, public areas even the communal toilets were spotless. The corner room (sound proofed) we occupied on the sixth floor was excellent in every respect, very spacious with a small balcony for gazing down La Grand Via, free safe and small present of chocolates at turn down. Large spacious bathroom with another window for looking the opposite way up the Grand Via, fully stocked with towels changed daily and toilet and bidet cleaned, sanitised and sealed each morning. 	1
Extraordinary hotel and service It is my first time to write such review. I don't normally write but I had to write after staying at the Only You. It will definitely define your Madrid experience! Staffs were very friendly and nice, the best hotel staff members I have ever met in Europe. Thank you very much to all the staffs at the Front desk and at the breakfast lounge (Especially Thanks to Diana and Hector, a few names of staff I can remember) Room was very clean, modern and decorated beautifully. A la carte breakfast was delicious with staff member's caring, attentive service. Front Staff were so genuinely kind. Can't ask more. Thank you for kindly giving guidance to a newcomer to Madrid. 	1
Small but lovely room, great service and location We loved it here...friendly service, comfortable lounge for a drink and a lovely room.	1
Great location nice hotel and staff This hotel is well placed yet quite, which is key in Madrid. You don't want to walk for blocks and blocks to get to the major attractions like the Prado Museum, Royal Palace and Plaza Mayor. 	1
Cool, hip hotel Nice renovation of an old property in the heart of Madrid's Chueca district. We had the standard room which was small but adequate and fully expected of city centre hotels. However, it was very nicely decorated with every mod-con, even a hair straightener which was my first encounter anywhere. The hotel is well-located to reach all of the sights in Madrid, it is near the Mercado San Anton and also Plaza Espana. The bar downstairs was very happening and attracts even a local crowd. We also tried the restaurant but the menu was very limited and the food mediocre. 	1
Beautiful hotel and great staff My husband and I recently stayed here for one night after travelling through Spain for two weeks. From the moment you walk through the hotel doors you know you are in for a treat. The reception and lounge decor simply make you want to set down your luggage, grab a cocktail and relax, and the friendliest staff I've come across invites you to do just that. (The staff arranged a very early wake-up call for us, as well as a taxi, and both were exactly on time--when we got downstairs at 3:30am, we were greeted with smiling faces all around). The beautiful decor continues in the rooms--modern and sophisticated with a nice zen feeling. I had the best sleep of my entire trip--the bed was off the charts comfortable and I would happily trade in the custom mattress set I have at home for one of the hotel's (wish I'd thought to take a peek at the mattress before I checked out!). From the hotel it's only a short walk to get into the city centre where you can start your sightseeing or have your pick of restaurants. I would definitely stay here again and only wish I'd had a few more nights at this lovely hotel. 	1
Amazing hotel - very modern and well thought out! We booked at this hotel knowing we'd want somewhere nice after a 29 hour flying ordeal. It did not disappoint. The staff were wonderful, the room was small but exactly what we needed.	1
Perfect stay! I just spent 5 nights at the Only You Hotel and it was an all around pleasant and recommendable experience! The staff is super nice and helpful and makes you feel comfortable and provides excellent advice when asked. We had a premium room facing the street and it was the quietest sleeping experience I could have asked for - shutters that close out light, gorgeous king size beds and thick walls. I old 100% recommend this hotel for both business and pleasure! 	1
Lovely hotel - Can't wait to go back! This hotel is just great. You step off the street into a modern, cool reception area to be greeted with a welcome drink and very attentive staff. Rooms are great and have all the modern facilities, free wifi ipod docks etc. The hotel is decorated to a very high standard and the cleanliness is spot on.	1
Excellent hotel We stayed at the Only You Hotel for 3 Nights and we enjoyed every moment there. The hotel is perfectly located in the Chueca area, nice design and super friendly, helpful and professiomal People working there. We can highly recommend this hotel! 	1
Wonderful Stay Great location. Upgraded to a wonderful suite. Wonderful and helpful staff. Modern and very efficient rooms. Unfortunately, construction being done on a building directly across the street but the electric blinds muffled most of the noise. Would visit again, in a heartbeat. 	1
We like it here There is little point giving anyone five stars, or is there? No 4 star hotel in the middle of a capital city will ever be that good; however, this is a good establishment. The staff are really attentive and kind, the hotel is well organised and run, and strangely enough the restaurant is of a pretty good standard. We had supper there over two consecutive evenings, and it was just what we wanted. If you are a tourist looking for a good base that you are happy to go back to, then this is the place and I hope you enjoy it as much as we did. 	1
Excellent Hotel for Madrid We had a Premium room for our stay in the Hotel Preciados. Compared to the other hotels we stayed at during our trip (Barcelona, Nice, and Florence), this hotel by far was the best value for the money.	1
Impressive stay Wonderfully located and well appointed room. Really enjoyed this stay. The receptionist was really professional and helpful, and continued to call me by name my entire stay. 	1
Excellent position in MAdrid Stayed for 6 nights, end of June beginning of July 2014. Our room had a street view but was very quiet. The free minibar a great advantage. Just beware that the 15% discount for their restaurant is only valid once only. Superb position, at walking distance to the main attractions. 	1
Great location Stayed for two nights at end of June .Took my in-laws, both 80, for a short break so needed a central location and the Preciados was situated centrally for the City. On site car park with valet parking was really convenient-just make sure you arrive at the right end of the street as its all pedestranised ! Ate in the restaurant one evening and both the food and service was excellent. Breakfast was buffet style with a great choice All the staff were very helpful. Rooms were comfortable, the free mini bar is a nice touch however some tea/coffee making facility would have been appreciated. Highly recommended 	1
Great choice Good location to be able to walk to major vacationer destinations; room was very clean, and quiet (as promised). The breakfast buffet was great - lots of choices, tasty. Staff was helpful. A.C. functioned well. 	1
an ideal hotel We stayed here 4 nights in June, 2014. Preciados provided everything I could possible expect.	1
Wonderful hotel and staff We really loved our stay at Orfila - a charming small, quiet and relaxed hotel with excellent staff and lovely food and drinks. The Gin and Tonics alone are worth the stay! Lovely terrace and wonderful breakfasts (mmmm almond tart) - a real gem. Thanks to all the staff 	1
A Gem! My husband and I just enjoyed a total of 13 nights at the Hoel Orfila and what a pleasure it was! Small, friendly, homey and sooo lovely! Right on the edge of the Serrano on a quiet street. Short walks away from charming restaurants and cafes, boutiques and embassy mansions. Not part of the noisy city but easily accessible to all the sights and attractions. We loved it everyday of our stay. The excellent hotel staff was always there to help, to offer suggestions, to arrange for drivers, and to get us the best reservations available. And our room was so very comfortable and relaxing. Our bed was the greatest! We had Wifi available inside and out. I would be remiss to not mention the beautiful garden patio, the excellent indoor/ outdoor restaurant and the Spanish breakfast Buffet. We will never stay anywhere else in Madrid. Hotel Orfila is the epitome of class, comfort, pleasure and style! 	1
Fantastic small hotel in Madrid Hotel Orfila is a marvel, with no small thanks due to JosÃ© and the other excellent front desk staff. The hotel's location is superb, the rooms charming, the public areas elegant and quiet, and the restaurant understated and professionally served. We stayed at the Orfila twice, at the beginning and at the end of our visit to Spain, and both experiences were consistently positive. Many thanks - and thanks to Ernesto, as well, for taking good care of us and being so kind. 	1
A "Gem" in Madrid This is an excellent small hotel in a perfect location in Madrid that will allow you to walk to almost all attractions. We stayed there from June 10 to June 13th. The hotel is charming and the staff is excellent. The service level is very high and all coincierge recommendations were spot-on. Also, we experienced a 24 taxi strike while we were there. We had a dinner reservation at a restaurant too far to walk. They provided a driver to take us and pick us up at no charge. Also, I met a friend from Madrid and he was impressed that we had selected the hotel...he said he always selected it for his business clients. He commented"you must have done your homework" in selecting the hotel. Yes we did...thank you trip advisor. 	1
A small oasis of charm in a big city We chose the Hotel Orfila in Madrid because we had stayed at previous Relais & Chateaux properties in other cities and countries and had been consistently impressed with their intimacy and unique style. The Hotel Orfila did not disappoint. From the moment we stepped in the door the service was open, warm and friendly. We could not fault our room - spotless, beautifully quiet and charmingly decorated. From the welcome glass of cava on arrival to the complimentary bottle of cream sherry in our room and the romantic evening meal in the courtyard, everything seemed to be done to make our stay a delight. All we can say is thank you - we will be back. 	1
Charming in excellent location With our car wisked off by valet to their parking lot, and welcomed by a friendly staff with a glass of cava, we immediately liked the Orfila. We were originally given a beautiful top floor room overlooking the courtyard with King bed, but had to switch because the room next door had children and noisy occupants. We were given the same room on floor below, slightly smaller and no King bed! But Nicoletta, the chambermaid, fixed our bed to make it a king and all was well. The staff is actually the best feature of the Orfila; they are welcoming, friendly, very helpful and anxious to please. Our favorite was Marcos, who was very knowledgeable about the area and where to find restaurants and food (such as Madrid's famous roast crackling pork) we were interested in.	1
Excellent Loved this place..... Great staff..... Marcos Kos was great.... Very helpful and lovely on the eye!! ALL staff were excellent and I am really sorry I lost the paper with the other names..... It was my husbands birthday weekend...... (27th..... Well really 53rd)! Was treated with complimentary champagne and then a bottle of champagne in the room.... Then chocolates and then fruit..... Was a brilliant weekend......thought it maybe a little far out but metro really easy and Alonzo Martinez the metro yo use...... Madrid very friendly and very clean city.... Loved it all and thanks to you all for a fantastic weekend........... Xxxx 	1
Business trip made easy I spent just one night here in the middle of May 2014 and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. The hotel is very classical and slightly old-fashioned but it's very charming and extremely comfortable. Fabulously comfy beds, spacious bathrooms and rooms and a welcoming and relaxed dining experience. The staff couldn't do enough to help and having such a short stay, it was extra-important that everything was perfect. Quiet rooms, all the facilities you'd expect for this level of hotel but with the addition of a certain old-fashioned charm. Lovely! 	1
Wonderful hotel..highly recommended We arrived at 11pm after a delayed flight and received a warm welcome which set the tone for the duration of our 3 night stay - the staff at Hotel Orfila are excellent.	1
Great Stay My husband and I stayed for three nights and found the service in this boutique hotel outstanding. We were very impressed with how helpful all of the staff were, without being intrusive. The room was spacious, comfortable, clean and very quiet. Thanks for a wonderful stay. 	1
Wow, Wow, Wow! We have just returned from our 3 week family European Vacation and we would have to rate this as one of the best hotels that we stayed in.	1
excellent location we started our holiday in spain with madrid and stayed at the splendom suites gran via.. a very well located apartment hotel.. spacious rooms excellent service and well equipped..pleaaant and helpful staff.. walking distance to most attractions.. plaza mayor, royal theatre, royal palace, puerto del sol and prado museum.. with a metro station 5 minutes walking distance..we were a family of 2 adults and 2 children and stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment 	1
Very convenient for families with young kids As a family with two young kids, we enjoyed our stay in a suite. Our suite was well-equipped and clean. The hotel is within walking distance of most places of interest in the centre of Madrid and the staff is very helpful. 	1
Fantastic apartments, great for families who want affordable luxury I cannot fault the hotel and staff at all and we have high standards. As husband, wife and an 8-year old we spent 3 nights in the 2-bed apartment just off Gran Via. Facilities were great: good WiFi, lovely staff, even a children's play room, free tea/coffee, biscuits, cereal and even sweets! It was superior hotel service in an apartment setting. 	1
Perfect home from home in Madrid. We stayed five nights in a beautiful top floor suite at the Splendom, and couldn't have been happier. It was our first visit to Madrid and the location was perfect. It is near enough to Gran Via to be able to walk or bus to most of the museums and galleries, and right in the middle of the main shopping district. However it was very quiet, day and night, especially with the bedrooms being over an inner courtyard. A full kitchen with all necessary equipment enabled us to eat in whenever we wanted, but there is no shortage of restaurants and tapas bars nearby if you prefer to eat out. The suite was spacious, clean and bright. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the taxi shuttle to and from the airport which the hotel arranged was prompt and perfect. All in all I can thoroughly recommend the Splendom suites. Other hotels may offer grand public rooms, which the Splendom does not have, but who needs them. 	1
Great value, location and Madrid experience We really enjoyed our stay at Splendom. It feels more like you live in Madrid than a hotel yet you get maid service everyday, your own kitchen and turn down service. The Splendom Gran Via offers the little details of five star hotels (Hermes toiletries, expresso machine, Tea time box, huge fresh flower arrangement, etc) with the comfort of your own apartment in Madrid. The location is great just half block off Fuentecarral and Gran Via streets where all the awesome shopping is. Staff is super friendly. The beds and pillows are super comfy. Only down side is that you can hear your neighbors a bit too much. However the street is very quiet at night and just a few pedestrians during the day making it fun to people watch and see the vibrancy of the city from your own cute little balcony. We also loved the decor, chic, modern and simple. Can't wait to be back in Madrid and stay at Splendom. 	1
Great Hotel, Great Location We first found this hotel via the Hotel Tonight app. It was a great deal, it was very highly rated and in the middle of Chueca, Madrid's gayborhood. We arrived and were very pleasantly surprised at the level of service, the clean, modern appointments, and thoughtful design of the hotel. The lobby is sized perfectly, it has snacks and juices. The gentleman at the front desk quickly checked us in and took us to our room and showed us around. The one-bedroom was great: large, comfy bedroom with a king sized bed, nice living room with a balcony, very nice bathroom, and a well-appointed kitchen. Best of all the water pressure in the shower was awesome! I would easily recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to be centrally located to the Gran Via, to walk everywhere and discover Madrid the right way. 	1
Unbeatable location and great value We booked this hotel purely based on other reviews and couldn't have been happier. we got a really good price online and the value for money was great. Located about a minute away from the Gran Via metro station it is a brilliant location and is in walking distance of many of the tourist attractions in Madrid. By the reception desk there are complimentary drinks and biscuits/sweets.	1
As advertised, great location, good staff Stayed here with family and as other reviewers have stated it really is perfectly located. Our room was spotless and the kitchen facilities were good. Staff on the front desk were very friendly and sorted out a problem we had with noisy neighbours. Indeed, the only potential problem here is noise from outside. We were on the first floor and on the Friday night there was quite a lot of toing and froing outside until the small hours. The noise was markedly less on the Saturday and non-existant on the Sunday. Those of a nervous disposition should note that there are a few streets off the Gran Via which are slightly less salubrious than other parts of this grand city, although this did not bother us at all. An excellent alternative to run of the mill hotels, we would stay here again. 	1
Great location for tourists, great service We stayed 3 nights at Catalonia early June. It is in the heart of Madrid and you can walk from here anywhere, including the subway, the royal palace, El Prado and many important city parks and places. We didn't eat at the hotel because it is surrounded by restaurants but they do serve food. We sat in the lobby bar once and it turned out a relaxing experience: great service, great complimentary snacks and great drinks. A great little hotel to enjoy Madrid day or night. It worked for us! 	1
Far exceeded our expectations! We have 2 nights left of our 4 night stay but the front desk has been wonderful. our wallet was stolen today and after spending an afternoon at the police station, the hotel worked tirelessly with us helping to make phone calls to our credit card companies. Besides our room and location being great, the staff was outstanding. 	1
Great Location We arrived early in the morning. The very helpful staff went ahead and checked us in and provided us a free, excellent breakfast. It was a perfect start to a great stay in Madrid. Our room was very spacious, nicely decorated and well maintained. The location is perfect, close but quiet. 	1
Great location, room, price I can only echo the observations of others. Wonderfully placed. Not the hotel if you want glamour and public rooms to impress others, your money goes to get a good room at a good price. Very pleasantly quiet, subdued even, a relaxing place to stay in the middle of the action. 	1
Excellent location in an historic hotel Loved this smaller style hotel which was very centrally located right opposite Santa Ana and very close to the major attractions. Loved the ambience and decor - this hotel is a converted 18th century aristocrats house - from our first impressions at check in , where the very friendly girl had fluent English (rare in Spain), and showed us a map and explained where the main attractions were. We were offered a welcome drink which we enjoyed on our first night talking to the friendly bar man. We had a lovely room with a huge bathroom with very good quality products. This was our first time in Spain and it set an excellent example. We were made to feel very welcome.Would stay here again. 	1
Be aware of gran melia fenix We stayed at the GRAN MELIA FENIX . This hotel is really beautifull. As a regular costumer we loved to stay here. Things have changed now. After the last visit the doormen took our luggage into the hotel. After a few hours we found out that one of our bags was not brought to our room and missing. At the desk they checked security tapes and saw that sonebody had come into the hotel and had stolen one of our suitcases. After some conversations with the managing director they promissed us that they would take care of the damage. After a few weeks of email traffic and sending in all saleslips of our property they changed their opinion and do not want to take responsibillity. A lawsuit will be nessesery. SHAME GRAN MELIA FENIX. Not worth to be a 5 star hotel. People be aware of this hotel. 	-1
Location only. Nothing else to offer This hotel is great for location only. The rest, not so much...	-1
Disappointed - do not stay here Just spent four days at the Wellington - the initial checkin was so disorganized and unaccommodating that I initially reacted that I would change hotels - should have done so!. the rooms weren't ready, we were "upgraded" to an unattractive suite - outdated but clean. The reception staff seemed almost baffled that we expected our rooms to be ready an hour and a half after checkin time.	-1
Restaurant Quality and Service The hotel is a high quality building with modernistic and well appointed rooms. It boasts a gourmet restaurant which is absolutely terrible? It's aspirations are not matched by the service which can only be described as chaotic and unstructured, or by the food which was both tepid and tasteless.	-1
NOT Reliable The hotel itself was sufficient for an overnight stay, however if you are planning to use the airport shuttle look elsewhere. I booked a shuttle the previous night upon my arrival at the hotel, double checked with the concierge that I was reserved, only to find out the morning of my flight that they had not actually reserved a spot on the shuttle for me. They asked me to get off the shuttle and wait an additional 25 minutes for another shuttle. I had to call a taxi which cost â¬25 and nearly missed my flight. If you are looking for a reliable hotel, do NOT choose this hotel. 	-1
well designed but not great I stayed at the indigio Gran Via for two nights on a business travel. I had booked a standard room. When I checked in I received a room with a window facing the patio. When I tried to change this room I was told that the standard rooms are all in this location. The rooms are very small and the noise in the rooms is quite bad. I could hear when somebody in the room above flushed the toilet. Not very nice. The elevator takes ages.	-1
Not the best The king room was ok but with no natural light it felt claustrophobic. The pillows are poor which is a shame as the bed is comfortable. There was no booklet in the room to tell you how to use the coffee machine, we noticed the instructions were on the card for the room, seemed a bit of a cost saving idea but felt penny pinching. The light in the wardrobe constantly flashed which was annoying.	-1
Nice new hotel with bad sound insulation and poor customer service I don't want to write a lot, as I already completed the full customer satisfaction questionnaire (sent to me by email following the stay), but in brief: 	-1
be aware!! terrible drain smell bathroom and room. Be aware and take a serious draiÌn smels complains also other customers review for this hotel!!! We first stayed praktik bakery in barcelona which belongs to same hotel chaiÌn with praktik metropol. First one was good and thats why we decided to stay in madrid praktik metropol. But this hotel was ever worst hotel we stayed for a while. First night we stayed room 206 (superior room) toilet was smell drain terrible and they couldn't chanced it because they have no room available that night. also we informed that building is very old and they can't do nothing for drain smell. Besides no shower separation in bathroom, curtens are dirty, bed sheets smell and only bed and to side table in this superior room nothing else. Second night moved to room 210 was much worst than first one. Bathroom and room smell horrible drain in the night time, impossible to sleep. We discovered that smells come from continuously two power sockets which located both sides of bed, besides bathroom. Room contain more furniture but doesn't make sense in this conditions.very poor breakfast. There are three different hotels in the same building, use same elevator like a apartment. I wrote my complain to directly to the hotel web site but no one replay me so far, maybe hotel manager can explain us how they sell that terrible smelling rooms twice to us for 3 nights? 	-1
Disappointing We had booked 5 nights here . The hotel itself is beautiful and that unfortunately is where it ends. The basic problem here is that this hotel does not care about its clients. We left after 2 nights to another hotel and no one even asked us why.... I have even emailed the hotel since and no answer to my concerns. 	-1
Very nice staff, clean rooms - but ... We stayed at this hotel over three nights, starting from Friday. The hotel itself is nice and is clean and the staff are very helpful. However, we did have problems with noise.	-1
Poor property I just came from a marvelous experience in Sofitel in Portugal and came to this property. The experience is such a drop off I can't help but express my disappointment in standards. I tried to book a restuarant but the Conceirge was so nasty about it and the attitude was terrible. The rooms were ok but had no bathtub. The location was really in the middle of nowhere. How can this be considered as four star? It was also poorly kept and the common areas looked like it needed renovations. 	-1
no good, old, tired - no status recognition The hotel is near Madrid exposition center, so its away from the city-center and the old town. However, it is near a subway station and Madrid subway is easy and nice. The neighborhood is one of the best in town and there is a park just 500 meters from the hotel - the park is fantastic. If you like to run or to walk in the park, its for you. Also, the park has some sculptures. So, there are many pros for staying away from the city-center.	-1
Hardly a three star hotel There are so many negatives to this hotel-dodgy neighborhood, miniscule room, bed advertised as king but no larger than a double, cheap finishes, tiny elevator, shower holder broken, no plugs for charging electronics, one of us had a view of industrial piping, embarrassing choice. Don't stay here if you want a decent accommodation. 	-1
Not so good I use to live in Madrid and knew this location would be good but	-1
Where is my discount for Le Club? I booked this hotel from accorhotels.com and I save a discount for my 4000 points. But the recepcionist in the check out simply ignored by the number of discount points and charged me the full amount of the stay. Very bad, very bad. 	-1
Disappointing. If we had not prebooked room would not have stayed. Great location. 4 stars? No. The room was very claustrophobic. Not only did it not have any view out but it had frosty windows that only open a crack at the top so you can't see out at all. Feels like you are underground. 	-1
Completely far away Don't get confused by the name. It's not in Castellana (at least not in the part where Castellana could be considered part of Madrid).	-1
For the price you are paying it is not worth it The room was so small is was like a compartment room in a train. The toilet was in the bedroom basically divided by a glass pane. The window had no view and the hallways were dark. 	-1
Only for the Location This is a place to I stay for the location only - near our Madrid office. The bathrooms are in dire need of repair and tend to leak from the floor above. The shower drain was slow if not entirely clogged, and there was a wet floor mat in it when I arrived. The wi-fi works, intermittently, and there is a proper desk in the room. Wen I arrived late Sunday evening, I had to wait half an hour for the two at the reception to handle an group of travelers, each one individually.	-1
Not a 4 star Hotel Positives - Very nice and modern room Front desk staff helpful. Negatives - Food 2 Star at best, Bar 2 star at best, bar and restaurant staff very poor service and attitude, not what you would expect from a Barcelo Hotel..My work mates had company discount rates I did not. I would not stay again and would not recommenf this hotel. 	-1
NOT a 4 star hotel! Stayed there for 2 nights. We thought that it was a 4 star hotel as claimed but it is, at best, only a 3 star hotel. The hotel had offered a 2x2 family room (2 connected rooms) at the time of booking but we were told that they don't have such a room when we checked in. 	-1
Very Bad Experience. Avoid staying here My husband and I stayed at this hotel for just one night which was our last night in Spain. The room given to us (ROOM 406- DOUBLE BED) looked good from the way it was kept and the bathroom looked neat too. Since we wanted to make our last trip to Puerto de Sol, we decided to quickly freshen up and leave. 	-1
