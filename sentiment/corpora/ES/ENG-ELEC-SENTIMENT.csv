The Windows Phone 8 is an intriguing proposition offering up something very different to the iOS and Android systems we've become accustomed too, and the Lumia 920 is currently the most powerful handset running it
Integrated with its super-thin chassis, HD screen and beautiful graphics, the One X is the next-generation Android platform, all rolled into one
The HTC Windows Phone 8X is a premium-feeling device with a brand new iteration of the highly elegant Windows Phone OS
 It has almost every connectivity option you could ask for and a camera with increased light allowance on the lens
the Samsung Galaxy S3 still holds a position among the top ten showing it's still something quite special
it's fantastic
Let's take a minute and talk about the screen: it's beautiful
 The 309ppi pixel density is up there with the sharpness of the iPhone 5
The most obvious improvement the iPhone 5 offers over the iPhone 4 and 4S would be its taller, higher resolution display with room for a fifth row of icons
 It has made the phone just a tiny bit more difficult to use with one hand, but for photo viewing and movie watching, the extra screen real estate is much appreciated
As Android smartphones go, the LG Optimus G is a pretty capable, if nondescript, handset
 Apparently, the folks at LG thought they could do one better, and the result is the 800-pound gorilla known as the Optimus G Pro
If you're going to put a massive 5,5-inch display on a smartphone, make it a good one - and that's exactly what LG has done here
 Paired with photos taken using its effective rear camera image sensor, this is a screen you won't mind spending hours looking at
We're excited about the prospect of the HTC One Mini, as it's a handset with all the best bits of the HTC One without as much of the cost
 That's got to be hitting a new segment of the market, right
We love that the functionality of the One Mini isn't compromised from its larger relative, with the likes of UltraPixels and BoomSound all involved without being watered down
 HTC has been very clever in the design of this phone by bringing nearly every great element of the One to the smaller version, and packaging it in a way that still makes it very attractive
The Samsung Galaxy S4 is a phone that we really, really like
 The combination of powerful innards, the market's best screen and a clever design ethos all combine to make a really strong contender for the handset you should be buying when you wander into your local phone emporium
The HTC One's combination of innovation and sumptuous hardware is a testament to the brand, and shows that new things can still come to our smartphones without costing the earth
 Sure, it's not the cheapest handset by any means, but it's perfectly in line with what we'd expect from a flagship
Our only real gripe is with storage: many will argue that expandable memory slots are unnecessary when you've got Dropbox on board for extra space, or that simply being organized and deleting unwanted content will solve the problem
 That's true to a degree, but it's not common behavior for today's smartphone user
Though it's pretty much a dressed up, slightly nicer version of the iPhone 5, the iPhone 5C at least has decent improvements and a low price tag - if the starting pay of $99 with a two-year contract is your thing
The LG G2 is the beastly smartphone that is LG's answer to the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One
 It's a massive, yet not entirely unwieldy, smartphone brimming with great specs
The display and camera are really killer, and performance is incredible
 It ate up every benchmark for breakfast, turned out great photos and dazzled us with its high-resolution display
 Oh, and on top of that, battery life was a charm
The Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is quite similar to its predecessors, the Galaxy Note and Galaxy Note 2
