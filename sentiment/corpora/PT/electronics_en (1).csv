"Best Shredder.....EVER!! We have owned two previous small business class shredders.  This is our third.  Without any doubt, it is the best shredder I have ever used/owned. I bought this to replace our reliable Fellowes DM15C Shredder.  That unit still works great, but my toddler son now has the dexterity and strength that would theoretically allow him to open up the sliding plastic CD/Credit Card sheild that served as the main barrier between his little hands and the powerful shredding mechanism.  Also, after watching one of our cats activate the shredder twice in the past week while using it as an intermediate step to the office window, it seemed like a problem waiting to happen. SAFE-SENSE (Every Shredder Should Have This) The main thing I liked about the SB-99Ci is the Safe-Sense technology that shuts off the shredding blades when a hand (or any other body part) gets too close to the blades.  In addtion to the no-brainer step of powering the thing off when I am not around, this technology looked like a very good backup protection to ensure that my young son retains all of his fingers until adulthood. The Safe-Sense technology is extremely effective.  I did not realize that it works by detecting fingers etc. when they come into contact with the metal trim that surrounds the shredder mouth (I thought the trim was just decorative...but it is functional).  This is an extremely reliable detection method (i.e. vs/ tryng to detect motion or heat) and IMMEDIATELY shuts down the shredder if it is operating, or prevents it from operating at all if it has not started up yet.  There is even a nice little LED indicator that lights up when the Safe-Sense shutoff is triggered, so it is very easy to test it out from time to time.  Of course, there is a well hidden switch (that requires positive effort to adjust) that allows you to disable Safe-Sense if you don;t want/need it, but I can't think of any good reason that anyone would want to do that. OTHER NICE STUFF While Safe-Sense was the primary motiviation for this purchase, I also really liked the clean and simple styling of the unit, and was very pleased to see that it has a good build-quality when I received it in-person. Another pleasant surprise is how QUIET this thing is when it is operating.  The motor is so quiet that the main thing you hear while it is doing its job, is the actual sound of the blades pulverizing whatever you are feeding into it.  The motor is a low-level (and low frequency) drone in the background.  I thought our previous Fellowes shredder was quiet, but the SB-99Ci puts it to shame. The designers of this unit also added some enhancements that, although not totally neccessary, are very nice to have.  For example, the strip of unique LED indicators on top of the shredder is great to have.  Our previous unit had a single indicator for ""bin-open"" and ""bin-full"" which forced you to do limited investigation to figure out why it was lighting up.  The SB-99Ci lets you know EXACTLY what is going on with an intuitive sybmol that lights up.  Finally, the little progressive ""efficiency graph"" is neat to watch, although I doubt I would ever use it to optimize my shredding throughput, which is purportedly what it is designed for. If you are looking for an attractively designed, well built, easy-to-use, and most importanly SAFE shredder for your home or small business, the Fellowes SB-99Ci is an excellent choice.","1.0"
"Hefty 30 Gallon bags fit My PS55CC lasted me 10 years so I knew I would be buying another Fellowes after it died.  I replaced it with a PS-79Ci but after 5000 pages over 1 weekend I decided I needed something larger.  So far I've been very happy with this one.  I wanted to point out that Hefty 30 Gallon Twist Tie Blue Large (2' 5.75"" x 3') trash bags ($4.59 for 24 at a midwest home center where you save big money) fit this shredder.  I think for this size of shredder you need to use a bag.  The bin is large and unwieldy and it is rather difficult to invert and empty it into a garbage bag.","1.0"
"I didn't beleive it... Having used shredders for years, I am very adept at jamming them.  I didn't believe that this shredder would not jam, but it is true.  You have to work hard to trick the sensor to cause it indigestion.  Even then, it will usually clear it automatically.  The Safesense safety feature is awesome and the design is high tech. It is more expensive than a lot of shredders out there but if quality and safety are important to you, it is worth it. Only negative so far is the wheels are difficult to put on.  I ended up leaving them off since I don't intend to move it around.","1.0"
"Worth The Money This is the 4th shredder that I owned.  The prior ones were noisy, and quickly jammed.  This is worth the money - you only get what you pay for.  Jams are corrected all by themselves - I tried to jam this machine, it is almost impossible.  Love the safe-guard technology that saves your fingers.  The metal that surrounds the paper slot is heat sensitive to your fingers or any other body part and immediately stops the machine.  This does not happen if you put paper on the metal strip.  The SB-99Ci was a little bigger and heavier than I thought, but it is medium to heavy duty use and lives up to that.  It takes 17 pages at once and most shredder bags and some recycling bags fit into the bin.  The other thing I love about this machine, is that when it indicates that the bag is full -it is full.  No need to tamp down the paper because it doesn't bunch up in the middle of the bin.  All the other shredders that I own, I had to constantly tamp down the paper and shred again cause the paper piled up in the centre and never filled the bags on their own.  This may seem small, but i have other things to do than to sit there tamping down paper, unjamming slots, and shredding 3-5 papers at a time.  I wanted a machine that I can put the paper in and that's that - no machine sitting.  Oh, and did I mention that it is extremely quiet - unbelievable!  Every other shredder let every one know I was shredding.  One thing though, don't forget to oil the machine.  This is quite simple, just put the oil bottle's nozzle along the slot with the machine in reverse and then run in reserve for 10 seconds (they say to do this after each bag full to perserve the cutters).  That is all the maintenance that it needs.  This is the one to own and the 2 year warranty is a plus and is the lifetime warranty on the cutting blades for the life of the shredder.  Fellowes is excellent on their warranties.","1.0"
"Almost a 5! This shredder was bought for a small office. I love the 17 page capacity and safety features it has built in. The second day we had it a toddler put his fingers by the shredder slot. Thank goodness the safety feature works!!! The only downfall I can see with this shredder is that when you empty the waste basket, you have to kind of play with it to get it to go back correctly. Not a big deal, but is a minor inconvenience. It will not work unless the waste basket is reinstalled correctly and tightly. It is a level 3 security shredder, munching up 17 pages with ease. Mine came with oil for the blades and 3 waste basket liners. The Amazon ad said it came with 36 liners, but that was a misprint and I believe they have corrected that. Even so it was a great deal and $80.00 less than the office supply store wanted for it. Best shredder I found for the money!!!!","1.0"
"Effective, effortless and safe The prior home office shredders had short life spans---too many jams, too little capacity, etc.  I felt a larger, stronger shredder would be the answer---and so bought this one.  It arrived fully assembled, except for the rollers (I needed help to install the castors).  So far: perfect.  Quiet.  Safe--authomatic sensor shuts the machine off should fingers and paws get too close to the slot.  Takes multiple sheets in larger quantities.  Window allows me to see when basket is full.  This is a new model for 2008 and I am very pleased with it!","1.0"
"INTELLISHRED SB-99CI SHREDDER 3229901 I have had 5 shredder's so far, burned them all out.  This schredder is possible one of the best I have ever used, aside from an industrial at the main office(4X the sixe and probably 5X the cost).  Mult-Sheet feeds / CD's / Staples - takes them all down.  Shredded an entire filing cabinet in a fraction of the time.  There is only one engineering modification I would make.  When removing the plastic bag it tears.  The reason is the fill window on the front of the machine.  Typical use would have a person shred a series documents then push the shredding to the bottom of the bag to allow additional clippings.  After several iterations of this the bag become quite snug in the bin.  The view window has a clear plate with 4 screws, I would recommend a rounded version of this window rather than sharp edges to ensure easy removal of the bag. Dont let this engineering design on the bag removal sway you from a truely amazing shredder, I solved the issue by simply not using a bag and then pouring the clippings into a hefty after shredding.","1.0"
"UNSATISFACTORY I bought the Powershred 99Ci based on its impressive specifications and features, and also because of the many positive reviews it had received online from other customers.  However, I'm not happy with this product.  The problems I encountered with the use of this shredder are as follow:  The 99Ci does not shred junk mail, i.e., unopened envelopes that contain more than 3 or 4 sheets of paper.  The machine is too sensitive in that it stops shredding when the paper bin is only half full, requiring frequent emptying of the bucket, which is a nuisance.  The 99Ci is advertised as having the capability to shred up to 17 sheets of paper at a time, but in my experience, sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't; and when it does, it struggles to get the job done.  I haven't had a chance to test the machine's cool-down period that would be required after 25 minutes of continuous use, and therefore cannot provide any useful comment about that particular function.  In a nutshell, the 99Ci that I received and have used does not justify its high price.  The manufacturer should either improve this product, carefully check them all before they leave the assembly line, or lower the unit cost.","0.0"
"Solid shredder - The intellishred works very well to quickly dispose of reasonable sized stacks of documents.  It is very easy to load the documents in, and it is handy that the shredder indicates when it believes you are putting too many pages in and it will jam.  I upgraded from an 8 page shredder, and this one goes much faster.  In addition, its basket is easily accessed and the larger capacity means much less frequent emptying.  Although it is advertised as quiet, I would say it is only somewhat quiet (or quiet on a loud scale).  The most disappointing aspect is that it does not appear to easily take the advertised 15 pages at a time, and it is somewhat of a nuisance when it jams.","1.0"
"I Love This Beast! I had owned this shredder for about a week when it suddenly stopped shredding, so I requested permission to return it.  Then, it hit me that there might be a reset button on it.  Sure enough on the back of the shredder there is a power switch.  Apparently, a power surge had knocked out my power.  I  flipped that little switch and it was perfect again.  So, of course, I cancelled my return.  It says it will take 17 pages.  That's a bit of a stretch.  If you want to clog your machine, you can try 17 pages; however, about half that many will work better.  I have had my beast for three months now, and have done some pretty heavy-duty shredding--shredding a bunch of old income tax returns, etc., and she is humming right along.  I also love how quiet it is.  I have a smaller one that is much louder than this one.","1.0"
"Fellowes Powershed 99Ci Review While I like many of the features on this shredder (very quiet, doesn't continuously run when on, safe touch feature, can handle many sheets), there are also some negatives.  The paper is shredded into larger pieces than my previous device so it tends to stack up in the bin, requiring you to adjust the waste or empty the bin.  I also wish the bin was bigger.  I seem to have to empty this one more often than my last shredder although they are about the same size.  Otherwise, it's a very good product.","1.0"
"Not a Heavy Duty Shredder I went into this purchase because I read a ton of great reviews.  I was looking for a quiet shredder that would take 10-15 sheets at a time with a rate of about 10 fpm .  It sounded like this was it from the reviews. Fellowes claims in the specs that it will take up to 17 sheets at 12 fpm but it gets maxed out with no more than 4-5 sheets of 20lb paper.  It has a gauge on top that shows the level of difficulty.  When it peaks out (which is often), it reverses the blades and then tries it again.  This is how the ""anti-jam"" technology works.  But, that creates a lag-time that reduces the fpm by more than half.  So, I have to watch how many pages I feed it at a time. It has a 9 gallon bin which is a little flimsy and a when I pull it out, there are shredded pieces and some dust that fall outside the mouth of the bin.  So, there is some clean-up to do.  I keep a dust-buster handy to vacuum out the shell when I change the bag.  Sliding the bin into the shell requires lining it up just right and giving it a good shove or it wont close all the way. It is quiet, I'll give it that. Maybe I just got a lemon, but I am not impressed.","0.0"
"What a machine! I have owned other shredders, but this one is by far the best and most powerful.  And it is very quiet - as advertised.  I use this in my home office and it has handled every job without missing a beat.  I purposely tried to feed too much into it to see if it would jam - but it didn't.  When it senses an 'over feed' it stops, reverses enough to clear itself and then continues feeding and shredding the papers.  Very impressive.  The bin is a good size too, so you can accomplish quite a bit of shredding before having to empty it.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good, reliable shredder.  So far it has been worry and trouble free.","1.0"

"MEDIUM POWERED SHREDDER This is the 3rd shredder I have owned. I ungraded from a Staples $150.00 shredder which I owned for about 3 years to this higher price Fellows shredder at Amazon for $221 (office depot $250.00 staples $350.00) hoping for a more powerful and quiter machine. The Fellows SB-99Ci was quiet but lacked power. I at first was shredding only about 5-8 sheets and after about one month it started to jam on a regular basis. I would clear the machine and tried to use lubricant shredder sheets to speed it up and stop the jamming. I finally was shredding at max 5 sheets and experienced frequent jamming. I decided to return it to Amazon. Amazon was very helpful in returning the defective shredder.","0.0"
"RETURNED IT TWICE Right out of the box did not work.  We tried troubleshooting according to fellowes website--still did not work.  Returned to Amazon and received replacement. The replacement did the same thing!  We called fellowes customer service and tried what he had us try, same thing.  Nothing worked.  He basically said return it.  Possible bad batch of shredders produced and shipped to amazon??? Returned for a refund.  Now still looking for a heavy duty shredder.  Ugh!","0.0"
"Overheats constantly/can't take much paper. We use this as the law firm I work at and it's terrible.  It doesn't jam though. It overheats very quickly and won't be usable again for quite awhile.  It only shreds a few pages at a time.  We scan files into a computer to archive but can't shred the 150-200 pages per file.  It should be a very quick 20 minutes job but it ends up taking hours longer as we have to wait for the scanner to cool down and have to shred only a few pages at a time. We also had a wheel fall off and quite often the drawer doesn't fit back in and you have to shove it a few times.","0.0"
"Fellowes 99Ci Shredder Likes:  Better than the old Fellowes shredder, it has more features. With my old shredder, I forgot to read the instructions and did not service the shredder by applying vegetable oil to the cutters after each drawer fill up, so the old one broke down after a couple of years. The drawer size of 9 gallons takes my 13 gallon biodegradable bag nicely. You can stretch the bag over the back of the drawer, and the front has two protruding notches for the bag. I had lots of paper to shred, and completed 9 bags filled over a few days. Machine works well although none are extremely quiet. The specs. say you can shred 17 sheets. I prefer keeping the number of sheets in the green light. I found the following: 17 sheets = red light.  14-16 sheets = Orange 2 light.  11-13 sheets = Orange 1 light.  9-10 sheets = green 5 light.   8 sheets = green 4 light.  4-7  sheets = green 3  light.  3 sheets = green 2 light.  2 sheets = green 1 light. Must use vegetable oil on the cutter after filling each bag. You can buy shredder oil or I assume use any clear vegetable oil. Dislikes: Very minor issues. The castor wheels really need to be pounded into place.  I used clear shipping tape to smooth the edges inside the drawer around the viewing port. This keeps the bag from tearing when full.  The cut paper tends to bunch up directly under the cutter which trips the ""full' red light. You may have to open the drawer and pat down the paper three or four times before bag is full.  The small bottle of oil supplied is pretty small and you will have to make a stopper for it. Fellowes make a 12 oz. bottle with an extension nozzle that is too large. This really wastes the oil. I found a travel bottle with flip up nozzle that works well (try Target).","1.0"
"Better Than I Thought It Would Be It took me a short amount of time to figure out whether or not this unit was going to work for me.  I have a mountain of junk mail that I am helping a friend get rid of and I needed a powerful shredder that I wouldn't have to worry about getting clogged all the time.  Well this guy is doing the job!!  I'm not totally convinced that it is shredding 17 pages, but at least if I put an envelope that is too thick, it will let me know.  And so far, it has not jammed once. I am very pleased with this shredder and am happy to recommend it!","1.0"

"Don't buy it! I ordered this shredder for use in my home office.  I was impressed by the many reviews saying how great it is.  When I received it, it was broken.  There was a wire out of place that was preventing paper from going down the slot.  So, I called the Fellowes number that is on the shredder.  Customer service immediately knew what the problem was and agreed to send me a new one and a label to return the broken one.  Great customer service, I thought.  Then I received the second shredder.  It too was broken - simply would not turn on.  Another call to customer service; another prompt agreement to ship me a new one; and another return shipment label.  I now have the third.  This one shreds great, BUT the sensor that is supposed to shut off the machine when little fingers are near the top isn't working.  I have little ones so I care. So I will call again, get another new one, and take yet another trip to UPS to return this one.  I'm beyond frustrated.  And, I can't return it because the little sticker on top of the shredder is from Fellowes, not the company I bought the shredder from, and Fellowes says ""we don't do returns"" and I'm now beyond the time frame for return and don't have the original item to return to the company I bought the shredder from.  I wonder what will be broken on shredder number 4.  Bottom line - it probably works great if you don't get a lemon but you'll probably get a lemon.  I would avoid this shredder!","0.0"

Here are the things that impress me: 1 - It is extremely quiet 2 - It has the power to shred 10+ thick stock paper 3 - It can continuously for almost 30 minutes before the over-heat function kicked in. 4 - It has an ""bin full shut-off"" indicator, that is a great safety feature 5 - It senses when fingers are near the shredder, and stops shredding. 6 - It has a large trash capacity, making it less of a hassle to empty it 7 - Compact design fits nicely in my office 8 - Decent looking, for a paper shredder. 9 - LED indicator tells me when I can feed it more (or less) paper based on the grade of the paper.

"Great Shredder for the Money This is the second PowerShred 99Ci that we've owned.  Is is used in a law office with 4 attorneys and support staff and it performs wonderfully.  Our first 99Ci lasted over 4 years (I'm sure that it would have lasted longer with proper maintenance; I learned too late that it is very important to periodically lubricate the shredder).  Fellowes customer support was very helpful while I was trying to fix our first 99Ci even though we were well out of the warranty period.  Follow the instructions provided in the manual (if you don't have the manual, go to the Fellowes website) and use the small bottle of oil provided with the shredder.  Replacement bottles of oil are available at office supply stores and online. We keep the shredder in a common area and it is used to shred dozens of pages of client information on a daily basis and occasionally much more depending on work load.  It is very easy to use and virtually impossible to jam (just keep in mind maintenance).  It accepts 17 pages as advertised and shreds staples, CDs, and credit cards.  If you try to shred too pages at one time, they are automatically rejected and forced back up so you can break the job into smaller pieces.  Everyone in the office loves the shredder and while we were waiting for the replacement, they were asking when the new one was going to be delivered.  The new one munched the backlog of 'too be shredded' pages in very short order. The Safe-Sense feature shuts down operation if your fingers come in contact with the paper slot during operation.  While not a huge problem in our office, I can see where this would be an important safety feature for those in a home office environment with children. I did see at least one review here that didn't recommend it for business office use.  They must have a larger office than we do, it works great for us. I highly recommend this shredder.","1.0"

"Good powerful unit. Minor mess issues Good unit. Powers thru almost everything. I've had it a month now and haven't broken it. That says a lot. The only downsides are related to the shredded paper bin. There's a window in the front that allows you to see how full the bin is. This window protrudes into the bin for no good reason. And when you pull out the bag full of waste, the window has a tendency to rip the bag and make a mess. The second minor issue is that the bin full indicator comes on a lot forcing you to open the bin and push the paper down. And when you do that it's easy to make a mess.","1.0"

"Great shredder in this class The shredder was  a breeze to assemble.  put a bag in the waste container in and slide it in, press in the wheels, take off a bit of labeling, plug it in and start shredding. The unit came boxed very well and had no damage to it or the packaging material. I have ran 17 sheets through it at once and it didn't drag.  Credit cards, CDs/DVDs...no problem. Doing 10-12 sheets at a time I shredded for 45 minutes straight and the unit didn't shut down, the unit says 25 minutes but it really wasn't working hard to shred.  It is extremely quiet.  The safe sense really does work when a hand gets near the opening...crazy, but I had to know. I am very happy with this unit and would recommend it.","1.0"

"Perfect for home or small office After finally burning out my 10 year old Staples shredder I was up for a new model.  I researched available models and decided on the Fellows 99Ci.  The Fellows 125Ci is almost double the price and I thought was probably overkill for my needs. Amazon shipping was stellar as usual. UPS delivery to my front door. Shredder technology has come a long way in 10 years.  This model is very quiet  and in comparison to my old one that you had to almost wear ear protection when using. You could talk on the phone and shred at the same with the Fellows shredder with barely any notice.  Jam free technology automatically clears any paper jams. Safety features look improved also to protect against finger intrusion (not that I plan on testing this feature)  It says you can put in up to 17 pages at a time but this is only for very thin paper.  Standard weight copy paper is closer to 7-8 pages.  Indicator lights glow green-yellow-red to let you know if you are putting too much in.  The bin is decent capacity for home use. The way the paper falls into the bin will turn on the ""bin full"" light a little prematurely as it mounds up. Just pull out the basket and redistribute the shredded paper in the basket  to get more capacity.  Fellows recommends using the supplied oil after each bag change.  The bottle of oil looks like it should last 5 years.  The machine looks very robust and well made.  Maximum continuous run time is 25 minutes which is a whole lot of shredding if you needed to get rid of a box of documents quickly (like get out of the embassy quick).  If you need to shred bank or credit card statements, confidential documents, etc. the 99Ci looks perfect for the job.  Cross cutting gives you peace of mind about putting the shredded pieces out for trash or recycling that nobody will read your confidential information.","1.0"
"Performs well; solidly built We purchased this for an attic full of shredding.  It did the job with ease.  It is solidly built, and simple to use.  I recommend it highly.  One minor point:  The description claims it can shred up to 17 sheets at a time.  In my experience, with normal 8.5"" x 11"" 20lb office paper, the limit is 16 sheets.  That's still not bad, and it can do 16 sheets easily and consistently.","1.0"

"Works great! After doing some research and reading reviews, I decided to buy the Fellowes 99Ci for our home office. We are very pleased.  It works great and isn't too loud. It's a bit larger than we had anticipated but like the fact that the bin holds alot. When the machine indicates it's full, you can pull out the bin and mash down the shreds then continue on.  It can be operated while sitting or standing with ease.  It came with oil and trash liners.  It's a nice machine.","1.0"

"Awesome Quiet. Fast. High quality. Cross cuts very well.  A little messy changing the bag but nothing a vacuum cleaner or shop vac can't finish up in 10 seconds.  Recommend buying the bags specifically made for it.  Buy it!  Don't skimp on some $75 cheap piece of junk with empty promises from any manufacturer including Fellows.  This is an excellent shredder and Amazon beat everyone's prices.","1.0"
"Finally! A shredder my wife can't break! I have... No, actually, my wife has gone through four shredders in the past two years.  This one has great power, it stops you from getting it jammed and is above and beyond the average wal-mart shredder.  The previous shredders were $60-$80 types.  I decided to spend the extra cash all at once instead of on a bunch of sub par garbage ones that are made to shred one piece of paper at a time.  I am very pleased with this purchase so far.","1.0"

"Wish computer manufacturers used this! My girlfriend's Dell M1330 laptop (refurb) started an annoying habit of the fan ramping up to maximum level.  After a lot of reading I updated the bios and video display drivers in hopes that that would rectify the issue and that the fan speed was a glitch.  That didn't work.  So I looked into making the machine cooler.  She doesn't always use the laptop on a flat surface, so that could be part of the issue.  I decided that a thermal grease change may help.  So I did a lot of research online and speaking to a few computer techs I know.  I decided to buy the Artic 5 and give it a try. Luckily her computer was easy to work on.  It was super-simple to get to her CPU.  I cleaned off the old, grey paste that was on the chip (and then some).  I used an alcohol pad like you would get from the hospital.  I've seen some people say to use a higher purity alcohol 90%, but I used the 70% that was on the pad.  Once all was clean on CPU and heat sink, I put a small drop of Artic 5 on the chip and spread it evenly with the tip of the product syringe (then wiped off the syringe before putting the cap back on).  Put the laptop back together and fired it up.  That was about 3 weeks ago and I have yet to hear the fan ramp up like it was doing before the grease change.  The temperature on both cores of the CPU have gone down immensely! I liked the performance so much, and had so much more grease left over, that I decided to do the job on my own laptop even thought I haven't had any cooling issues.  I guess you'd call it preventative maintenance.  I have a Dell Inspiron.  The job was not even CLOSE to being as easy, but I got it done and have had no problems.  My fan barely ever comes on, so I guess that's good. This stuff really does what they say it does!","1.0"
"Hey its arctic! this is best thermal compound out there! it decresed my cpu temp by 5 degrees!","1.0"
"Still the Best Arctic Silver 5 is still simply better than the competitive brands I have used.  Combined with the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO my i5 4670k idles at 29C and rarely gets over 45C even under heavy load.  And this is in a house that is not the coolest temperature wise. Tip: Use the line method as described on Arctic Silver's website.  Squeeze a line of this down the center of your processor leaving about 50% of the width of the processor exposed in total (25 on each side, so the line only covers the middle 50%).  Do not spread the compound!  Just apply the cooler directly onto the line and let the weight and pressure of the cooler spread the compound.  I tried this for the first time and found the temps about 5-10C cooler than the spread method.  I am using the line method from now on.","1.0"
"Great stuff I use this on my self-build PC and anytime I do a new build. Great product in a well thought out package.","1.0"
"Great i have always used artic silver for my own pcs and for upgrading other peoples cpu heatsinks. i am using this to attach a cooler master n520 cooler to an amd fx8120 processor in my own pc and couldnt be happier with the results. there are better thermal compounds out there however in my experience artic gives you the best bang for your buck.","1.0"
"Good stuff I use Artic Silver for all of my home custom builds, most recently on a budget build a couple weeks ago, as this is better than the standard stuff included with the CPUS that you get.  All you need is  a thin layer on the CPU and you will be set.  This keeps the CPU heat dissipated and I have never had any failure using it.  Usually around 5 bucks is the standard price for this.","1.0"
"Good Stuff - Really worked My i3-540 Intel Retail cpu installed on an Intel motherboard was overheating - hitting 104 C and shutting down.  I couldn't run the win7 performance without overheating.  The problem was that the supplied thermal transfer for the heat sink wasn't working very well.  The Arctic 5 arrived and it would get 5 stars except that, to install it, I had to find 3 things = pure alcohol, a no-lint swab, and an 'old' credit card.  If you have all these things handy, then you give it 5 stars.  Why can't Arctic charge $1 more and put a little sealed up swab, with a piece of plastic in the package and make the whole experience easy?  anyway, now the cpu idles at 32 C, and runs up to about 46 C when working hard in the performance test.  It never gets out of the green band of the Intel CPU meter.  The instructions were very good, and although picky, they are easy to follow and give good results.  Great product.","1.0"
"Amazing! For a while now, my laptop would shut off whenever I try to play a game online or watch a really long video, I didn't know what was the problem until my cousin suggested that maybe my thermal paste needed to be changed. It worked! My laptop no longer shuts off unexpectedly and it feels cool to the touch even after a couple hours of using it. Would definitely recommend this to anyone!","1.0"

"Best Thermal Paste For Overclocking I paired this with the Koolance CPU-380i and the VID-NX690, a 4-fan cooper radiator and the pmp450. CPU is running at 4.6GHz and GPU is overclocked as well. The temperature for the CPU is 5-10*C and 25-30*C(Compare to the one Koolance includes which ran at 40-55*C) on Prime95 at room temp of 75*F, and GPU runs at 20*C idle and 35-40*C(Compare to the one Koolance includes which ran at 60-75*C) on 3DMARK11(EXTREME). This is definitely the number one thermal paste on the Market.","1.0"
